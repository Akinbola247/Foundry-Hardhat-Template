# Sample Hardhat-foundry Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat-foundry use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks to get started:

```shell
run npm install
run forge install
```

Run tests for hardhat and foundry: 
```shell
npx hardhat test/fileName.ts 
forge test
```
